# Audio Wave Signal Processing

A modular audio signal processing project built in Python and C++.  
Designed for mastering core DSP concepts through `.wav` file analysis and real-time audio streaming.

## Goals
- Understand DSP fundamentals: filtering, FFT, STFT, envelope detection, etc.
- Prototype in Python, optimize in C++
- Apply concepts to lab research and trading systems

## Structure
- `python/`: Analysis, visualization, I/O
- `cpp/`: High-performance DSP modules
- `data/`: Sample .wav files
- `notebooks/`: Signal experiments and prototyping

## Getting Started
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
